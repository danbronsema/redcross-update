In April, two young people from the Hill House in Rutherford, New South Wales, commenced volunteer work with Riding for the Disabled.

The young people volunteer for a three hour shift once a fortnight. This has provided a great opportunity for these young people to gain skills while engaging with members of the community.

Dylan Thompsett, Manager, Unaccompanied Minor Program, Marist Youth Care, received the following email from Riding for the Disabled:

**Hey Dylan,<br>
Firstly this month, two young people from Hill house started volunteer work with Riding for the Disabled.
They are planning on attending once a fortnight, for around 3 hours.**

**During their first shift, they were responsible for putting the bridles on the horses, leading them from their stable, walking, brushing \[the horses\], and cleaning their hooves. They each then led their horse whilst the clients were riding.**

**They performed all of these tasks very capably and as their experience increases so too will their responsibilities.**

While the young volunteers learn new skills, they will also benefit from the therapeutic effects of making a meaningful difference to others and working with these beautiful, well-tempered animals.
