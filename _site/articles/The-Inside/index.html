<p>As you would be aware, Red Cross provides humanitarian assistance and advocates for the most vulnerable people in the Australian community, including asylum seekers and refugees. Refugee Week, from Sunday 16 June to Saturday 22 June, is a time to promote understanding of refugees and celebrate their many contributions to Australian society.</p>

<p>The theme of Refugee Week this year is “Restoring Hope”. Refugees and asylum seekers hope for a safer life and seek opportunities to achieve their potential. They bring skills, experience and resilience that provide valuable contributions to their new communities.</p>

<p>Despite the many hardships they have experienced, refugees and asylum seekers generally retain the strength and skills they need to re-establish their lives. This is more likely where they have been provided with support and have access to the services they need during the process of refugee determination so they are able to make informed decisions about the future for themselves and their families. Red Cross is proud to work in partnership with a range of agencies to ensure those supports are available for people seeking asylum in Australia.</p>

<p>In this issue of Update you can read about some of the fantastic initiatives that are being developed across Australia by Red Cross teams and our partner agencies alike. In these pages you will also find some useful information designed to inform your work and support asylum seekers by building on their resilience and restoring hope.</p>
