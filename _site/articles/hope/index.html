<p>Haider will never forget his first day in the Community Detention program that helped him find a safe home and meet new friends.</p>

<p>Haider is a Hazara, one of the ethnic minority groups in Afghanistan that has been persecuted by the Taliban. Although the Taliban government brought security to the country, they also incited violence against the Hazara minority.</p>

<p>“It was very difficult to live there because of the Taliban targeting Hazaras,” says Haider. His parents, fearing for the safety of Haider and his five siblings, were forced to consider their options to protect their children. They decided to send their older son to Europe. That was the last time Haider heard of this brother.</p>

<p>“Many of our people have been lost, they’ve been killed, they just sink in the ocean and no one knows about them.”</p>

<p>Haider’s parents made the heart- wrenching decision to save Haider by sending him to Australia.</p>

<p>“It was disgusting, it was terrible,” says Haider of the next six months travelling from Pakistan to Thailand to Malaysia on boats, planes and buses.</p>

<p>“We were told that we’d be transferred to a bigger boat, but we weren’t. They lied. We could have been killed; the water was jumping very high, 6 meters high. We were lucky we survived.”</p>

<p>Haider arrived at the Christmas Island detention facility and began the long wait for his visa application. For many asylum seekers the refugee determination process can be complex and lengthy. People struggle to cope with the isolation of living in a detention facility, not being able to work, knowing little English and being without the comfort of family and friends.</p>

<p>Haider will not forget the day, after a seven month wait, that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship decided to move him from a detention facility and into the care of the Red Cross Community Detention program in the town of Ballarat, Victoria.</p>

<p>As a minor who came to Australia without family, Haider received 24 hour care from Life Without Barriers, a Red Cross partner organisation.</p>

<p>Red Cross caseworkers, Peter and Melissa, put Haider in touch with English teachers and the local community. Haider particularly appreciated being able to join the local soccer team. “I didn’t know anyone, but they say I can play with them. Every week we play. We came home [from soccer], cooked our own food and enjoyed it.” It was Haider’s first home-cooked meal in over a year.</p>

<p>After Haider received his visa in January 2011, the local soccer team organiser, Rich, helped Haider enrol in University of Ballarat TAFE course to become a mechanic. Haider is rebuilding his life with community support. He aims to work as a mechanic in Ballarat and looks forward to giving back to the community.</p>

<p>“Some people (Hazaras) are really having a really hard time now and need your help. But the world is round, you know? Now you help us. Tomorrow we help you.”</p>
