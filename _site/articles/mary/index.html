<p>In late March, Red Cross Migration Support program Tasmania was privileged to have the first showing of the new documentary, ‘Mary Meets Mohammed’ by local Tasmanian filmmaker Heather Kirkpatrick. The film follows the opening of Tasmania’s first detention centre through the eyes of local woman and knitting club member Mary and detained Afghan Hazara asylum seeker Mohammad, as they connect through the gift of a knitted beanie.</p>

<p>The Bridgewater Community Engagement team has supported the Pontville Knitting Group and Red Cross Migration Support program staff have supported people detained at Pontville so this topic has resonance with our work at many levels.</p>

<p>‘Mary Meets Mohammad’ was selected as one of four finalists in the national F4 Award for Outstanding Documentary Talent 2013.</p>

<p>The documentary premiered in Adelaide as part of the Australian International Documentary Conference [AIDC] and will be touring Australia in 2013. Visit ‘Mary meets Mohammed’ on facebook for details.</p>
