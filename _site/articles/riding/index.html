<p>In April, two young people from the Hill House in Rutherford, New South Wales, commenced volunteer work with Riding for the Disabled.</p>

<p>The young people volunteer for a three hour shift once a fortnight. This has provided a great opportunity for these young people to gain skills while engaging with members of the community.</p>

<p>Dylan Thompsett, Manager, Unaccompanied Minor Program, Marist Youth Care, received the following email from Riding for the Disabled:</p>

<p><strong>Hey Dylan,<br /> Firstly this month, two young people from Hill house started volunteer work with Riding for the Disabled. They are planning on attending once a fortnight, for around 3 hours.</strong></p>

<p><strong>During their first shift, they were responsible for putting the bridles on the horses, leading them from their stable, walking, brushing [the horses], and cleaning their hooves. They each then led their horse whilst the clients were riding.</strong></p>

<p><strong>They performed all of these tasks very capably and as their experience increases so too will their responsibilities.</strong></p>

<p>While the young volunteers learn new skills, they will also benefit from the therapeutic effects of making a meaningful difference to others and working with these beautiful, well-tempered animals.</p>
