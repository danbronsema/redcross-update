<p>Released on 19 June, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Global Trends report provides an overall snapshot of the state of forced displacement in 2012. A look at the countries that took in most of the world’s refugees puts Australia’s intake into a global perspective.</p>

<p>According the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), displacement created the highest number of refugees and internally displaced people in two decades, with the Syrian crisis having emerged as a major cause.</p>

<p>Of the 9.9 million refugees that were registered last year, only 30,000 were in Australia, or 0.3 per cent. In contrast, Pakistan hosted 1.6 million refugees, or 17 per cent of the world’s refugee population. Iran received 868,200 refugees, which was about half the number of refugees received by Pakistan. Together, Pakistan and Iran accounted for a quarter of the world’s refugee intake.</p>

<p>The other major refugee hosting countries for 2012 included Germany (589,700), Kenya (564,900), Ethiopia (376,400) and Chad (373,700). Jordan (302,700) and China (301,000) each hosted around ten times as many refugees as Australia.</p>

<p>In an ever-widening gap between richer and poorer host countries, developing countries accounted for more than 80 per cent of all refugees. Half were received by countries that have a per capita GDP of less than US$5000.</p>

<p>Nearly half of the world’s refugees (46 per cent) were children under the age of 18. Over 21,000 asylum applications submitted in 2012 were from children who were unaccompanied or had been separated from their parents—the highest number of unaccompanied or separated children ever to have been recorded by UNHCR.</p>

<p>Each day in 2012, around 23,000 people were forced to flee their homes, which equates to more refugees per day than the total number of people seeking asylum in Australia for the whole year.</p>

<p>This highlights the fact that the number of refugees and asylum seekers in Australia remains relatively low by global standards.</p>
