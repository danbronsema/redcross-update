<p>For Khalid and Hayfa, living in Iraq was not an option. Like many teachers in their homeland, they became the targets of kidnap, torture and death threats. They came to Australia in search of safety and have made it their new home, with the help of Red Cross.</p>

<p>Khalid, an academic, and his wife Hayfa, a teacher, were dedicated to teaching the future generations of Iraq. But in 2004 their homeland became a very different place. After the 2003 Iraq war ended, academics across the country became targets of persecution by religious conservative groups and schools were looted, burnt and destroyed.</p>

<p>“Life was very difficult. There was no safety and no freedom,” recalls Khalid. “Every day there was bombing and killing.”</p>

<p>In 2006, their son was kidnapped, tortured and lost the use of one of his fingers. “He still feels very traumatised,” says Khalid. “We feel the same.” Their other sons also received kidnapping and death threats.</p>

<p>Because of this dangerous situation, Khalid, Hayfa and their second son were forced to flee Iraq. They flew to Australia in 2010 and requested asylum on arrival. The family anxiously waited a year for an outcome on their protection visa application. It was during this difficult time that they contacted Red Cross.</p>

<p>“When we came here we had spent all of our money,” says Khalid. A friend suggested Red Cross could help. Red Cross provided the family with vital financial assistance and access to health care through the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme (ASAS). The program, funded by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and delivered by Red Cross, helped meet the family’s basic needs while they waited for an outcome on their visa application.</p>
<blockquote>
“They supported us with money but they also gave us much more love and support,” says Khalid. “If we lost our family, we found another family in Red Cross,” he says.
</blockquote>
<p>“Rachel is a very good woman,” says Hayfa of her Red Cross caseworker, who introduced Hayfa and Khalid to the community and helped them with other practical support such as filling in forms. “She’s our daughter. When we talk with her we feel like she is one of our family.”</p>

<p>In November 2011, they were formally recognised as refugees and granted protection. Since then, Khalid has been looking for work. “If you stay for a long time without a job you feel upset. It’s very difficult,” he says.</p>

<p>“I try. But unfortunately I fail.” He is determined to keep trying until he succeeds. He currently volunteers 30 hours a week working with children who have parents in prison and children living with disability.</p>

<p>Khalid and Hayfa both hope things will change in Iraq. They miss their son, daughter and grandchildren terribly.They hope one day they will be reunited in Australia. “We are waiting,” says Khalid. “We hope. We don’t forget hope.”</p>
